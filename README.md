# Project-3-clinic-appt-frontend

1. Technologies used - React, Mongoose

2. General Approach
Ideation: Neighborhood clinics are crowded especially with the ongoing pandemic and most of these clinics are not on online platforms which allow people to book appointments easily
Planning: Research on other projects done on the internet - clinic related, appointment booking related websites to get an overall idea of how the end product should look like
Execution: Started coding based on component level, starting from the register/login page. Each component should be working, both backend and frontend, before proceeding to the next component


3. Installation instructions
Install client dependencies - cd client, npm install

4. Unsolved problems/major hurdles
Have yet to include specific timeslots for appointment booking which will make the app more realistic
